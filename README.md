E-commerce Web Application with a nice and clean design. I've made this project to learn about MERN stack and to evolve my existing knowledge about JavaScript and REST API's opertions.
It tries to represend a tipical chlothes online shop just like the ones from Zara or H&M.

After cloning the repository run "yarn" to both api and clientSide folder to get the node_modules and after that "yarn start" to open the app.
